# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
This project consisted of assisting a client in determining the serious effects of what was referred to as the "Silver Tsunami." The company of Pewlett Hackard was anticipating a massive wave of retirements given the ages and tenures of their employees. They needed assistance in determine the possible extent of the retirements so they could assess how many positions they may need to possibly fill in the very near future. Additionally, separate data was requested to determine those employees that were eligible for a "mentorship" program. 

## Results of Project
    - The number of possible retirements that could lead to positions needing to be filled is 90,398. This comes as a result to pulling names of all employees that were born between 1952-01-01 and 1955-12-31.

    - After determining the total number of possible retirees, per request, the results were then sorted by job title. Most notably, there could possibly be 22,770 'Senior Engineer' position vacancies. 
    
    - Other vacancies would be 22,005 'Senior Staff' positions, 19,998 'Engineer' positions, 18,492 'Staff' positions, 4,502 'Technique Leader' positons, 2,629 'Assistant Engineer' positions, and 2 'Manager' positions vacant in the event of the 'Silver Tsunami.'

    - Next, the focus shifted to determining the employees that were eligible for the mentorship program. The criteria was to be born between 1965-01-01 and 1965-12-31. The final result of that query determined that there were 1,940 employees eligible for the mentorship program. 


## Analysis
In the event of the 'Silver Tsunami', Pewlett Hackard would be facing 90,398 vacant positions that would need to be filled. That is definitely no small feat to hire that many individuals and then have to train and assist them in acclimating. Unfortunately, with only 1,940 employees eligible for the mentorship program, it does not seem like a sufficient amount to help usher in a wave of Pewlett Hackard new hires. 

However, upon creating a new table of data that classifies the mentorship program by title, it does seem that, except for 'Senior Engineer', the 1,940 employees eligible for the program are well distributed throughout the positions that will be most in demand so that may prove to be beneficial to the company rather than if all 1,940 had been mostly in one only position.

Futhermore, an additional insight that was noted after the creation of another query, the departments that will be most affected are the Development department and the Production department.
